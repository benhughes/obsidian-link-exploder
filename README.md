# Overview

🔗💣

Link Exploder is a Obsidian plugin that creates a [canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas) from a note, embedding it's linked notes (and their linked notes). The new canvas will be added to your root directory using the name of the note it's based off.

## Use Cases
- Useful for converting those MoCs (Map of Contents) into a visual map visually exploring topics and how they interact with each other.
- Starting a canvas using items in your vault. Create a new note with a few links to topics you want to explore then call the "Create Canvas From File Links" action and you'll have a new canvas which pulls in the notes you linked as well as their linked notes too.
